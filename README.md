# Simon Says - Made Simply
## Introduction
There is an abundance of cheap microcontrollers on the market that have made it easier to explore and play with them.
Some companies even giving an incentive to students to buy their microcontrollers at a discounted price, this is an ideal time
to create projects with them. Using Microchip's PICKIT 4, we can create a simple Simon Says game in a short time in order to
understand how microcontrollers work. I hope that this will motivate high school students to create, build and explore 
more after you have completed this simple project. 

## Technologies 
### This projected is created with:
* C

## Launch
This will require some hardware to get this up and running:
* PICKIT 4 
* PIC16F1615
* 4 LEDS
* 4 220 OHM resistors
* Breadboard 

The last requirement is the program software or the IDE:
* MPLABX

An extensive tutorial to obtaining required parts and components can be found in the hardware folder as well as the setup 
instructions for MPLABX. There is a crash course tutorial on the basics of the electronics used which is in the hardware 
folder.

## Circuit Diagram 
Wire up the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram, if you're new to wiring circuits a fritzing diagram is provided 
for simplicity. 

## Get it Working 
1. Under the clone button, click on Download Zip
2. Open up MPLABX, create a project and name it to Simon Says but it could be named anything
3. Drag the main.c file to the "Source Files" under your project foler, this will copy it into your project
4. Proceed to drag and drop the remianing files into the "Header Files" in your project
5. Connect your PICKIT4 as shown in the "MPLABX Setup" file found in folder
6. Build your file using the hammer icon or F11
7. Now Make and build program 

If nothing caught on fire, you should have a working Simon Says game.  
## PCB Design 
### Congrats!
Hopefully you can see how easy it can be to get started with microcontrollers. If you want to take your design, you could 
create a PCB for it as well. Creating a PCB for this simple circuit is super simple too. you can either use KiCad to
design your own or you could use the one provided to you in the hardware section.
